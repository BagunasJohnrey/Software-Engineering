            <p>Chapter 1 Introduction</p>
            <hr>
            <p> We can’t run the modern world without software. National infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a
                computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is completely computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the
                music industry, computer games, and film and television, is software intensive.Therefore, software engineering is essential for the functioning of national and inter national societies.</p>
            <p> Software systems are abstract and intangible. They are not constrained by the properties of materials, governed by physical laws, or by manufacturing processes. This simplifies software engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of software. However, because of the lack of physical constraints, software systems can
                quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.</p>
            <p>1.<i> Increasing demands</i>  As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change. 
                                            Systems have to be built and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required;
                                            systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible. Existing software engineering methods cannot cope and new software
                                            engineering techniques have to be developed to meet new these new demands.</p>
            <p>2.<i> Low expectations</i> It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using
                                          software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted
                                          into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do
                                          not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently,
                                          their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be. We
                                          need better software engineering education and training to address this problem.</p>
            <p>Software engineers can be rightly proud of their achievements. Of course we still
               have problems developing complex software but, without software engineering, we
               would not have explored space, would not have the Internet or modern telecommunications.
               All forms of travel would be more dangerous and expensive. Software engineering has contributed a great deal and I am convinced that its contributions in the
              21st century will be even greater</p>

            <h1> 1.1 Professional software development</h1>
            <p> Lots of people write programs. People in business write spreadsheet programs to
                simplify their jobs, scientists and engineers write programs to process their experi
                mental data, and hobbyists write programs for their own interest and enjoyment.
                However, the vast majority of software development is a professional activity where
                software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices,
                or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional
                software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed
                by teams rather than individuals. It is maintained and changed throughout its life.</p>

            <p>1.<i>Generic products</i>These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is able to
            buy them. Examples of this type of product include software for PCs such as databases, word processors, drawing packages, and project-management tools.
            It also includes so-called vertical applications designed for some specific purpose such as library information systems, accounting systems, or systems for maintaining dental records.</p>

            <p>2<i> Customized (or bespoke) products</i> These are systems that are commissioned by
                    a particular customer. A software contractor develops the software especially
                    for that customer. Examples of this type of software include control systems for
                    electronic devices, systems written to support a particular business process, and
                    air traffic control systems</p>
            <p> An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products, the organization that develops the software controls the software specification. 
                For custom products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization
                that is buying the software. The software developers must work to that specification.</p>
            <p> However, the distinction between these system product types is becoming
                increasingly blurred. More and more systems are now being built with a generic
                product as a base, which is then adapted to suit the requirements of a customer.
                Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as the SAP system, are the best
                examples of this approach. Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a company by incorporating information about business rules and processes, reports
                required, and so on.</p>

            <h3>1.1.1 Software engineering</h3>
            <p>Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of
               software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:</p>
            <p>1.<i>Engineering discipline </i> Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively
            and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable theories and methods. Engineers also recognize that they must work to
            organizational and financial constraints so they look for solutions within these constraints.</p>

            <p><b>figure 1.2</b> Essential attributes of good software</p>
            <p>2.<i>All aspects of software production</i> Software engineering is not just concerned
                    with the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities
                    such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software production.</p>
            <p> Engineering is about getting results of the required quality within the schedule and budget. 
                This often involves making compromises—engineers cannot be perfectionists. People writing programs for themselves, however, can spend as much time
                as they wish on the program development.</p>
            <p> In general, software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their
                work, as this is often the most effective way to produce high-quality software.
                However, engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for a set of
                circumstances so a more creative, less formal approach to development may be
                effective in some circumstances. Less formal development is particularly appropriate for the development of web-based systems, which requires a blend of software
                and graphical design skills.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Software engineering is important for two reasons:</p>
            <p> 1. More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.</p>
            <p> 2. It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a
                   personal programming project. For most types of systems, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes called a software process. A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the
                production of a software product. There are four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes. These activities are:</p>
            <p> 1.Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.</p>
            <p>2.Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.</p>
            <p>3. Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.</p>
            <p>4. Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Different types of systems need different development processes. For example,
               real-time software in an aircraft has to be completely specified before development
               begins. In e-commerce systems, the specification and the program are usually developed together. Consequently, these generic activities may be organized in different
               ways and described at different levels of detail depending on the type of software being developed. I describe software processes in more detail in Chapter 2.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 1. Computer science is concerned with the theories and methods that underlie computers and software systems, whereas software engineering is concerned with the
                   practical problems of producing software. Some knowledge of computer science is essential for software engineers in the same way that some knowledge of
                   physics is essential for electrical engineers. Computer science theory, however, is often most applicable to relatively small programs. Elegant theories of computer
                   science cannot always be applied to large, complex problems that require a software solution.</p>
            <p> 2. System engineering is concerned with all aspects of the development and evolution of complex systems where software plays a major role. 
                System engineering is therefore concerned with hardware development, policy and process
                design and system deployment, as well as software engineering. System engineers are involved in specifying the system, defining its overall architecture,
                and then integrating the different parts to create the finished system. They are less concerned with the engineering of the system components (hardware,software, etc.).</p>

        <section>
            <p>As I discuss in the next section, there are many different types of software. There is no
               universal software engineering method or technique that is applicable for all of these. However, there are three general issues that affect many different types of software:</p>
            <p>1.<i>Heterogeneity </i> Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems
                                       across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. As
                                       well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also have to execute on mobile phones. You often have to integrate new software with older legacy 
                                       systems written in different programming languages. The challenge here is to develop
                                       techniques for building dependable software that is flexible enough to cope with this heterogeneity</p>
            <p>2.<i>Business and social change </i> Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They
                                                    need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software. Many traditional software engineering techniques are time consuming and
                                                    delivery of new systems often takes longer than planned. They need to evolve so that the time required for software to deliver value to its customers is reduced.</p>
            <p>3.<i>Security and trust</i>As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is
                                         essential that we can trust that software. This is especially true for remote software systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to
                                         make sure that malicious users cannot attack our software and that information security is maintained.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Of course, these are not independent issues. For example, it may be necessary to make rapid changes to a legacy system to provide it with a web service interface. To
              address these challenges we will need new tools and techniques as well as innovative ways of combining and using existing software engineering methods.</p>

        <section>
            <p><b>1.1.2 Software engineering diversity</b></p>
            <p>Software engineering is a systematic approach to the production of software that takes into account practical cost, schedule, and dependability issues, as well as the
               needs of software customers and producers. How this systematic approach is actually implemented varies dramatically depending on the organization developing the
               software, the type of software, and the people involved in the development process.</p>
            <p> There are many different types of application including:</p>
            <p>1.<i>Stand-alone applications </i>These are application systems that run on a local computer, such as a PC. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to  be connected to a network. 
                     Examples of such applications are office applications on a PC, CAD programs, photo manipulation software, etc.</p>
            <p>2.<i>Interactive transaction-based applications</i>These are applications that execute on a remote computer and that are accessed by users from their own PCs or
                    terminals. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce applications where you can interact with a remote system to buy goods and services.</p>
            <p>3.<i>Embedded control systems</i> These are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded 
                    systems than any other type of system. Examples of embedded systems include the software in a mobile (cell) phone, software that controls anti-lock braking in a
                    car, and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking process.</p>
            <p>4.<i>Batch processing systems </i> These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to
                    create corresponding outputs. Examples of batch systems include periodic billing systems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.</p>
            <p>5.<i>Entertainment systems</i> These are systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user. Most of these systems are games of one
                     kind or another. The quality of the user interaction offered is the most important distinguishing characteristic of entertainment systems.</p>
            <p>6.<i>Systems for modeling and simulation</i> These are systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which
                    include many, separate, interacting objects. These are often computationally intensive and require high-performance parallel systems for execution.</p>
            <p>7.<i> Data collection systems</i>These are systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.
                     The software has to interact with sensors and often is installed in a hostile environment such as inside an engine or in a remote location.</p>
            <p>8.<i> Systems of systems</i>These are systems that are composed of a number of other software systems. Some of these may be generic software products, such as a
                     spreadsheet program. Other systems in the assembly may be specially written for that environment</p>
            <p> Of course, the boundaries between these system types are blurred. If you develop a game for a mobile (cell) phone, you have to take into account the same constraints
                (power, hardware interaction) as the developers of the phone software. Batch processing systems are often used in conjunction with web-based systems. For example, in a company, travel expense claims may be submitted through a web application but
                 processed in a batch application for monthly payment.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, there are software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types of software system:</p>
            <p> 1. They should be developed using a managed and understood development process. The organization developing the software should plan the development
                process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will be completed. Of course, different processes are used for different types of software.</p>
            <p> 2. Dependability and performance are important for all types of systems. Software should behave as expected, without failures and should be available for use
                when it is required. It should be safe in its operation and, as far as possible,
                should be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently and should not waste resources.</p>
            <p>3. Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) are important. You have to know what different customers
                and users of the system expect from it and you have to manage their expectations so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule.</p>
            <p> 4. You should make as effective use as possible of existing resources. This means
             that, where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed rather than write new software.</p>
            <p>These fundamental notions of process, dependability, requirements, management,
             and reuse are important themes of this book. Different methods reflect them in different ways but they underlie all professional software development.</p>

            <h3>1.1.3 Software engineering and the Web</h3>
            <p>The development of the World Wide Web has had a profound effect on all of our lives. Initially, the Web was primarily a universally accessible information store and
                it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran on local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around 2000, the Web started to
                evolve and more and more functionality was added to browsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead of a special-purpose user
               interface, these systems could be accessed using a web browser. This led to the development of a vast range of new system products that delivered innovative services, accessed over the Web. 
               These are often funded by adverts that are displayed on the user’s screen and do not involve direct payment from users.</p>
            <p>This radical change in software organization has, obviously, led to changes in the ways that web-based systems are engineered. For example:</p>
            <p> 1. Software reuse has become the dominant approach for constructing web-based systems. When building these systems, you think about how you can assemble
                 them from pre-existing software components and systems.</p>
            <p> 2. It is now generally recognized that it is impractical to specify all the requirements for such systems in advance. Web-based systems should be developed
                 and delivered incrementally.</p>
            <p> 3. User interfaces are constrained by the capabilities of web browsers. Although technologies such as AJAX (Holdener, 2008) mean that rich interfaces can be
                created within a web browser, these technologies are still difficult to use. Webforms with local scripting are more commonly used. Application interfaces on
                web-based systems are often poorer than the specially designed user interfaces on PC system products.</p>
            <p> The fundamental ideas of software engineering, discussed in the previous section,apply to web-based software in the same way that they apply to other types of soft
                ware system. Experience gained with large system development in the 20th century is still relevant to web-based software.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Software engineering ethics</h3>
            <p>Like other engineering disciplines, software engineering is carried out within a social and legal framework that limits the freedom of people working in that area. As
               a software engineer, you must accept that your job involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills. You must also behave in an ethical
               and morally responsible way if you are to be respected as a professional engineer.</p>
            <p>1.<i>Confidentiality</i>You should normally respect the confidentiality of your employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.</p>
            <p>2.<i> Competence</i> You should not misrepresent your level of competence. You should not knowingly accept work that is outside your competence.</p>
